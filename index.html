            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p> This adult animated cartoon follows mad scientest Rick Sanchez and his grandson Morty Smith. The two get up to interdimensional  adventures and hijinx.
                Intelligent and witty humor collides with over the top dirty and vulgar comedy in this well written and animated tv show that is an instant cult phenomenon.

                Rick Sanchez, the super brain behind the operation, coerces his anxious grandson Morty into all kinds of trouble visiting different plantets, galaxies, and demensions.
